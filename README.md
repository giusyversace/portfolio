# [Project 1: Titanic Dataset — Descriptive Analysis](https://github.com/giusyversace/portfolio/tree/5b766e6a1e6a3b0ead46a35b61fa642aa4838c0e/TITANIC)
This project was created to practice and improve my skills in **Python**.
I chose the Titanic dataset because it's a well-known and structured dataset, which is ideal for developing a solid foundation in exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
The goal of this analysis was to:
- Explore the Titanic dataset through structured EDA
- Extract key insights about survival rates and influential variables
- Create professional, readable visualizations
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- PyCharm
## 📊 Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data inspection**
   - Checked structure, data types, and completeness (no missing values)
2. **Descriptive statistics**
   - Explored distributions of numerical features (e.g., Age, Fare)
   - Analyzed categorical variables (Sex, Pclass, Embarked)
3. **Visual exploration**
   - Pie chart showing overall survival rate
   - Stacked bar chart: survival by sex (%)
   - Boxplot: age distribution by survival
   - Heatmap: correlation between numerical features
4. **Focus on survivors**
   - Calculated percentage distributions of key features among survivors
